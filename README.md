# custom-Port-Scanner-using-Python

🌟 This Python script is a simple port scanner that checks for open ports on a given IP address within a specified range. It first validates the IP address, then prompts the user to input a port range (start-end). The script attempts to connect to each port and records open ones. For each open port, it tries to identify the service running on it. The results are displayed, showing open ports and associated services or a message if no open ports are found.

❗️The script is intended only for educational purposes to demonstrate how port scanning works.
